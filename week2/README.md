These are some of my original notes for this assignment:
------------------
Iterative Pattern: #931F00 Branches (geometric) with #50C24A Leaves (organic). Frequent pairs of Shiftry (a Pokemon) eyes embedded between branch gaps (one eye in the middle of one gap and the other in the middle of another gap). *As the pattern reaches its center, all the shapes get smaller. Vice versa as the pattern reaches its outer boundaries.

Leaves can come in four corners per container. Maybe extend from the middle like a 4-leaf clover?
