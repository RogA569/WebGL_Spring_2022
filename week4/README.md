I will attempt to recreate the scene in Kevin McGloughlin's video of Max Cooper's 'Waves' from 0:30 to 0:40. This allows me the freedom of recreating one or both of the sequences seen in that timeframe.

Problems I Ran Into:
* Making all of the lines sprout up/down at once. Tried playing around with GSAP's timeline docs and changing the type of loop for generating the PIXI elements, but no luck.
