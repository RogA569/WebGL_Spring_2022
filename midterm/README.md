# Original Brainstorming for this Project

## Concept

- The user has to unscramble some objects laid around the screen and place them in the appropriate dashed areas. It’s very much like the game Operation because if you misplace the objects (which means placing an object in the wrong spot for 2 seconds), you get warning alarms indicating you’ve misplaced them. 
- The objects will form an abstract face (or two, if you count an initial frown and a subsequent smile as two separate faces).
- The background and its color is a main indicator of the overall artwork’s progression. As you go through the artwork’s main stages, the background either fizzles into a new color, or becomes a series of lines that shake for a few moments

## Objects

- A flaky, confetti rainbow (mouth)
- Two large eyes (eyes from my first assignment)
- Rounded trapezoid nose (like a teddy bear)

## Background

- Initial color: pastel pink
- Negative color: Dark purple
- Final color: pastel green

## Progression

- User can progress by moving the objects with the mouse
- Automatic progression through the artwork sequence by clicking numbers 1 - 9
- Each number is a percentage of the sequence, e.g. 5 for 50% of the sequence
- GUI has timeline controls for progression (closed by default)
