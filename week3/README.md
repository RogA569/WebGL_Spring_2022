My novel "visual clock" will be a series of six rectangles that move between the left, right, and center of the screen. They move in this manner one by one.

The rectangles, as they shift from the center to the right, represent the hours 1:00 to 6:00.

The rectangles, as they shift from the right back to the center, represent the hours 7:00 to 12:00.

The rectangles, as they shift from the center to the left, represent the hours 13:00 to 18:00.

And finally, the rectangles, as they shift from the left back to the center, represent the hours 19:00 to 24:00.

Since the rectangles are all in the center when it is 24:00, this also represents 0:00 (or the start of a new cycle).

The inbetweens of each hour can be represented mathematically through the movement of each rectangle as they move towards the left, right, or center of the screen.
